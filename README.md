# Thesis Project using NextJS (T3 Stack)

This project is based on my thesis practical demonstration, and is a NextJS (React) project. It was created purely for fun and learning purposes.

It is not a "real" real estate application. It is just a project to practice my skills and try new things.

However, I believe that it is a good start for a "real" real estate application. I hope you like it.
